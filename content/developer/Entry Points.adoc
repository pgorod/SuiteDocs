= 8. Entry Points

Entry points are simply a page which provides access to SuiteCRM. These
can be used for a variety of purposes such as allowing an external form
simple access to SuiteCRM or, as is the case with the stock Events
module, allowing an event invite to be responded to by clicking a link
in an email.

== Creating an entry point

Let’s create a simple entry point to display the time. First we define
this entry point in a new file in:

.Example 8.1: Entry point registry location
[source,php]
custom/Extension/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/



For our example we’ll call our new file *MyTimeEntryPoint.php*

.Example 8.2: Example entry point location
[source,php]
custom/Extension/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/MyTimeEntryPoint.php



In this file we will add a new entry to the `$entry_point_registry`. We
supply the file that should be called. Here we are simply placing the
file in custom if the entry point is related to a specific module it is
usually a good idea to place this somewhere inside
`custom/<TheModule>/`.

In addition we supply an “auth” parameter. If “auth” is true then anyone
accessing the entry point will need to be logged into SuiteCRM.

.Example 8.3: Adding an entry point entry
[source,php]
----
<?php
  $entry_point_registry['MyTimeEntryPoint'] = array(
      'file' => 'custom/MyTimeEntryPoint.php',
      'auth' => true,
  );
----



Finally we add the actual logic itself inside
custom/MyTimeEntryPoint.php:

.Example 8.4: Example entry point that outputs the current time
[source,php]
----
<?php
if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
$date = new DateTime();
echo $date->format('r');
----



After a Quick Repair and Rebuild we can access our entry point:

.Example 8.5: Custom entry point URL
[source,php]
example.com/index.php?entryPoint=MyTimeEntryPoint



and we should see something similar to:

.Example 8.6: MyTimeEntryPoint
[source,php]

Obviously this is a contrived example but any logic that can be
performed elsewhere in SuiteCRM can be performed in an entry point (for
example creating or editing
