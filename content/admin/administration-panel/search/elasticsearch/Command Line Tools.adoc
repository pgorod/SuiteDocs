{{% notice info %}}
This enhancement is only available in SuiteCRM from version 7.11 onwards.
{{% /notice %}}

SuiteCRM's Elasticsearch integration ships with two useful command-line tools powered by https://robo.li/[_Robo_].

These two commands allow to perform indexing and searches from the command-line, making debug and integration
with external tools easier.

{{% notice note %}}
These commands require a working connection to the database, if you are running SuiteCRM behind Docker or a VM,
please execute them from a shell on the same host as the SuiteCRM web server.

Both partial and full indexing are supported.

== elastic:search

The `elastic:search` command allows you to perform the same kind of queries you would do from the search bar directly
from the CLI. It also allows to return a JSON with additional data about the record.

=== Usage
[source,bash]
elastic:search <query> [<size> = 20] [<showJson> = false]

You can use the full query syntax for `query` argument.

The `size` option specifies the number of results.

When the `showJson` option is enabled a JSON will be returned for each result

=== Examples

Search for everything using the keyword 'rohan':
[source,bash]
vendor/bin/robo elastic:search "rohan"

Search for the first account named 'Maxwell' and show a JSON:
[source,bash]
vendor/bin/robo elastic:search "_type:Accounts AND named:Maxwell" 1 true
