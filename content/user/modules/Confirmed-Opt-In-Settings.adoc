= Confirmed Opt In

== Overview

*SuiteCRM 7.10* introduces a new *Confirmed Opt In* feature which provides two opt in settings for email addresses: *Opt In* and *Confirmed Opt In*.

. *Opt In* is used to indicate that a Contact, Lead or Target has opted in to receive marketing communications.

. *Confirmed Opt In* further requires users to confirm their opt in status by clicking a link sent to them via email. This email can be configured to send automatically (e.g. on submission of a Web-To-Person form) or manually, and the template used to send this email can be customised.

Once Opt In or Confirmed Opt In settings have been selected:

* An additional *Opt In* checkbox will be visible in *Detail* and *Edit* views for email address fields in Contacts, Leads and Targets.

* *Opt In*, *Confirmed Opt In* and *Pending Confirmed Opt In* status will be visible in List view for records in these modules.

* Web-To-Person Forms will automatically include an *Opt In* checkbox.

* Campaign emails will NOT be sent to email addresses which are not marked as *Opt In* or *Confirmed Opt In*, depending on which settings you choose here.
 
{{%notice note%}}This was introduced as an optional feature for those concerned with GDPR compliance 
in the European Union, but it is generic enough that you can use it for other purposes. If you don't need 
confirmed opt-in (also known as double opt-in) at all, just leave your setting as `Opt in`.{{%/notice%}}

== Opt In Email Settings

To configure your Opt In settings, open the *Admin* panel and select *Email Settings*. Opt In settings can be found on the *Email Options* panel.

=== Opt In

Select *Opt In* from the Opt In Settings: menu.

There is no need to configure the other Opt In settings, as Opt In emails are not sent with this setting.

Click btn:[SAVE]

=== Confirmed Opt In

Select *Confirmed Opt In* from the Opt In Settings: menu. 

image:GDPREmailOptionsConfirmed.png[title ="Confirmed Opt In Settings"]

With this setting, users are required to further confirm their opt in by clicking a link sent to them via email. 

Select *Automatic Opt In Email* to have this email sent automatically (e.g. on submission on a Web-To-Lead form).
The default template for these emails is the Confirmed Opt In template. You can edit this template from 
the link:../../core-modules/emailtemplates[Email Templates] module, but note that it must contain the Opt In link.

== Email Opt In Indication 

=== List and Detail View

Once *Opt In* or *Confirmed Opt In* is set, the status of a Contact, Lead or Target email address is indicated in both List view and Detail view with a tick or double tick.

|image:GDPRSingleGrayTick.png[title = "Pending List View"]|Email addresses which are pending an email confirmation are indicated with a single grey tick.

=== Edit View

An *Opted In* checkbox indicates the opt in status in Edit view.

Note that for *Confirmed Opt In*, manually checking the *Opted In* box here will result in a status of *Pending Confirmation*, rather than *Confirmed Opt In*. 
The user will still be required to confirm their opt in via email.

== Sending/Resending Opt In Emails Manually

If you have *Confirmed Opt In* configured, confirmation emails can be sent/resent manually, either in bulk or individually.

To send in bulk, select the records to send to by checking the boxes to the left of the records in List view.

Select *Send Confirm Opt In Email* from the *Bulk Action* menu.

To send to an individual, open the contact record and select *Send Confirm Opt In Email* from the *Actions* menu.

Email(s) will be sent silently (without confirmation) using the predefined template. 

== Campaigns

Your opt in settings will affect your target lists for Campaigns. Campaign emails will NOT be sent to email addresses unless they are *Opted In* or *Confirmed Opted In*, depending on which settings you have chosen.

=== Web To Person Form Opt In

When creating a Web To Person form, an *Opt In* checkbox will be automatically added after the email address field if *Opt In* or *Confirmed Opt In* is configured. 

image:GDPRCreatePersonForm.png[title="Web To Person form"]

If the user checks this box, the email address will be set as *Opted In* (or *Pending Confirmation* if you have *Confirmed Opt In* configured) when the record is created in *SuiteCRM*.

Note that if you have *Confirmed Opt In* configured and *Automatic Opt In Email* selected, 
the Opt In email will be sent automatically following submission of the form. 
If *Automatic Opt In Email* is not selected, these emails will need to be sent manually (see preceding section above).
