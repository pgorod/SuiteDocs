== Overview

The *Surveys* module allows you to create a web-based survey with a variety of question-type options. The responses received are stored in *SuiteCRM* and can be viewed on a per-respondent basis or as a detailed summary report using charts where appropriate.

Surveys can be sent as part of a link:../campaigns[Campaign].
