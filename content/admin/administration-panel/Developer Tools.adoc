=== Uninstall a Package

Unistall a package by clicking the buttons next to the 
package name. 

As with the install procedure, you will be asked

Click btn:[COMMIT] to uninstall the package.

If any errors occur during the uninstall they will be displayed here. 
Otherwise, clicking the *Display Log* link will detail the process.
