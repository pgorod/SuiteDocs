== Overview

The Campaigns module in *SuiteCRM* can be a very powerful marketing and advertising tool for your organisation allowing you to create and track both email and non-email based (e.g. telesales or radio) marketing campaigns to prospective or existing customers. 

With the tracking tools built into the Campaign module you can monitor the response you receive from your campaign in real time, allowing you to view the Return On Investment (ROI) and many other useful metrics. This in turn helps you to plan your strategic marketing and advertising activities effectively by visualising which campaigns work and which do not.

* To view the full list of fields available when creating a Campaign, see link:./../../appendix-a/#_campaigns_field_list[Campaign Fields List].

{{% notice note %}} 
You will need to configure your outbound and bounce handling mail accounts in order to send an email-based campaign. See Email Settings for information on how to do this. 

Campaign mail is sent using a scheduled job. You will need to ensure your scheduler is configured to do this.

== Create a Campaign

From the *Campaigns* module, select *Create Campaign* from the sidebar or the module dropdown menu to start the *Campaign Wizard*.

image:CampaignsSidebarCreate.png[title="Creating a Campaign"]

Select the campaign you wish to create: *Newsletter*, *Email*, link:../surveys/[Survey] (*SuiteCRM 7.10* onwards) or *Non-email based Campaign*. Non-email based campaigns allow you to keep a record of any campaigns that are run outwith *SuiteCRM* (e.g. a telesales or radio based campaign).

image:CampaignTypes.png[title="Select campaign"]

{{% notice note %}} 
Note that for a Survey campaign you will first need to create the survey to attach to the campaign.

=== Campaign Header

The first page of the *Campaign Wizard* is the *Campaign Header* page. 
image:CampaignHeader.png[title="Campaign Header"]

Enter a name for the campaign here and set the status (*Planning*, *Active*, *Inactive*, *Complete*). 

Add an optional description. 

The campaign will be assigned to the currently logged on user by default. Change this here if required.

==== Survey Campaign (*SuiteCRM 7.10* onwards)

For a *Survey* campaign, you will also need to relate the campaign to an existing survey. See link:../surveys/[Surveys] for information on creating a survey.

For a *Non-Email Based* campaign, you can optionally select the type of campaign.

Scroll down to complete optional budget details for the campaign. These figures are used in ROI calculations. 

For non-email based campaigns, this section is on the next page.

image:CampaignBudget.png[title="Campaign Budget"]

Click btn:[NEXT] at the top of the screen to continue.

=== Target Lists 

The next step is to specify your *Target List(s)*. 
Any existing target lists will be listed for you to select under *Add Existing Target List*.

Click on the target list name to add it to the campaign. Target lists added to the campaign will appear in the right-hand panel.

To remove a target list, click btn:[rem]

image:CampaignsTargetList.png[title="Target Lists"]

==== Create Target List

If you have not yet created a target list or wish to use a new list, you can create an empty one here and populate it after you have completed the rest of your campaign setup. See link:../target-lists/[Target Lists] for more information on the types of lists and how to use them.

image:80E-mail_campaign.png[title="Target list"]

Enter a name for the new list and select the type from the list. Note that you will need to have at least one 'default' type target list attached to the campaign.

Click btn:[CREATE]

=== Templates

The template is the message that will be sent out to your target list. You can select or edit an existing email template or create a new one here. See the Email Templates section of the user guide for more information.

{{% notice tip %}}The template editor used for creating and editing email templates can be selected in the link:../../introduction/managing-user-accounts/#_user_profile_email_settings[user profile email settings]. The default setting (Mozaik) is shown in the following screen shots. {{% /notice %}}

==== Email Variables

image:84Campaign_template.png[title="Email variables"]

=== Tracker URLs

Tracker URLs can be used to insert a link to your organisation's website or direct link to a new product that you have launched, for example. A unique id is added to the link for each recipient which allows *SuiteCRM* to track click-thrus. The information gathered can be viewed on the campaign status page.

image:83Campaign_template.png[title="Tracker URL"]

To add your own tracker URL link, click btn:[CREATE TRACKER]

image:CampaignsCreateTracker2.png[title="Create tracker"]

Specify the text to display as the link, and the URL.

Click btn:[CREATE TRACKER]

Add your tracker(s) to the template in the same way as for a variable. Click inside the template in the desired location, then select the tracker in the drop down and click btn:[ INSERT TRACKER]

==== Opt Out Tracker URLs

An Opt Out link allows the recipient to opt out of future marketing emails, and a default opt out link will be added to the template automatically. You can replace this default with your own Opt Out link text by adding a custom Opt Out Tracker.

Click btn:[CREATE TRACKER]

image:CampaignsOptOutTracker.png[title="Create opt out tracker"]

Specify the text you require for your opt out link.

Check the Opt-Out Link box. Note that you cannot edit the TrackerURL itself, only the link text.

Add your tracker to the template in the same way as for a variable. Click inside the template in the desired location, then select the tracker in the drop down and click btn:[ INSERT TRACKER]

Once your email template is complete, click btn:[SAVE].

Click btn:[NEXT] at the top of the page to continue.

=== Marketing

The Marketing section of the Campaign Wizard is where you need to specify the email settings for the campaign, and set a schedule for emails to be sent out.

image:CampaignsMarketing.png[title="Campaign Wizard Marketing"]

[cols="20,80", frame = "none", grid = "none"]
|===
|*Marketing Email Name*|Enter a name for the this run of the campaign. This allows you to resend the campaign at a later date to a different target list, or with a modified template. The campaign will store separate status details for each marketing record, and these can be selected on the campaign status page.
|*Bounce Handling Account*|Select the account set up to handle bounced campaign mail.
|*Outgoing Email Account*|This will default to the system outbound mail account. If you have other outbound mail a 
|*Schedule Date & Time*|The campaign emails will be queued for sending at the specified time and will be sent when the *Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns* scheduled job is next run. 
|===

Once details have been completed, click btn:[NEXT] at the top of the screen to continue.

=== Send Email and Summary

The Summary page includes a checklist which indicates whether or not each section of the Campaign Wizard has been completed satisfactorily. 

[cols="20,80", frame = "none", grid = "none"]
|===
|image:CampaignsGreenTick.png[title="Campaign section completed"]|If a section is complete then this is shown with green tick icon. 
|image:CampaignsRedCross.png[title="Campaign section incomplete"]|Incomplete sections are shown with a red cross. These will need to be resolved before the campaign can be sent.
|===

image:CampaignsSummary.png[title="Campaign Summary"]

In the example above the *Choose Targets* section has not been completed correctly as indicated by the red cross icon. This would be resolved by specifying a
'default' type target list with at least one entry. 

Click on any incomplete entry in the list to navigate to the relevant section.

Once you have ensured all sections are complete you have three options:

* *Send Mail at Scheduled Time* – Once you are sure all sections of the campaign are set correctly and your campaign status is set to *Active*, click to send the campaign emails. Email will be queued at the scheduled time, and will send to recipients when the *Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns* scheduled job is next run.   
* *Send Marketing Email as Test* – If you have specified a 'test' type  target list, this will send the campaign to the addresses on the test list only. By doing this you can view the campaign as a recipient and double check that it appears as it should do before sending out to real recipients. Test entries (views, click-thrus etc) generated can be removed later from the <<Campaign Status and Response Tracking,campaign status>> page.
* *View Details* – Shows the Detail View of the campaign you have just created.

== Campaign Status and Response Tracking

[cols="60,40", frame = "none", grid = "none"]

The campaign status page gives an overview of the campaign details as well as a graphical representation of your campaign response. This includes the number of messages sent, bounced messages, number of views, opt-outs and click-thrus. 

image:CampaignStatus3.png[title="Campaign status"]

Detailed information can be viewed in the subpanels below the graph, where responses are detailed on an individual record level. Here you can see who has viewed your email or clicked on a link, or how they have responded to a survey, for example. 

image:CampaignsStatusViewedMessage.png[title="Viewed messages"]

If the campaign includes a <<Web To Person Form, Web To Person form>> you will be able to see the details of any leads which have been created via the webform in the *Leads Created* subpanel.

These records can be added to a new target list by clicking btn:[Add to Target List] This allows you to create new, more focused campaigns based on who has responded.

This page gives a graphical representation of your campaign's Return on Investment, allowing you to easily visualise how money spent on the campaign has translated into potential
business.

The *Create Person Form* feature allows you to create a web-based form which will create a 
link:../leads/[Lead], link:../contacts/[Contact] or link:../targets/[Target] record in *SuiteCRM*

and are linked to a campaign so responses can be tracked.
