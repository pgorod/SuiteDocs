= Meetings

Like the Calls module, the Meetings module in SuiteCRM allows Users to
create a record of any Meeting that they have been involved in. The
Meeting scheduler allows a User to invite attendees, email invitees, set
reminders, reschedule and relate to other modules including an Account,
Contact, Project and many other Objects. This module has many more
helpful functions that assist the User to plan and organise their
Meetings.

== Meetings Actions

You can access the Meetings actions from the Meetings module menu drop
down or via the Sidebar. The Meetings actions are as follows:

* *Schedule Meeting* – A new form is opened in Edit View to allow you to
create a new Meeting record.
* *View Meetings* – Redirects you to the List View for the Meetings
module. This allows you to search and list Meeting records.
* *Import Meetings* – Redirects you to the Import Wizard for the Meetings
module. For more information, see link:./../../introduction/user-interface/record-management/#_importing_records[Importing Records].

To view the full list of fields available when creating scheduling a
Meeting, See link:./../../appendix-a/#_meetings_field_list[Meetings Field List].
