=== Introduction

The Studio tools allow you to customise the information shown in the
modules and how it is displayed.

To access Studio, log in as an Administrator user. In the top-right corner of the screen you find a menu with a profile figure icon. Click this icon, then select "Admin". Scroll down the page and click "Studio".

When Studio is opened, it will display a list of all the modules which 
can be customised. Click to select the required module.

can be set for the field:

[cols = "20, 80", frame = "none", grid = "none"]
|===
|*Data Type:*|The type you select determines what kind of characters can be entered

==== Field Types

Studio comes out-of-the-box with many different types of fields which can be created in SuiteCRM. 

The following data types are available when creating fields in Studio:

[cols = "20, 80", frame = "none", grid = "none"]
|===
|*Data Types*|*Description* 
|*Address*|Creates fields for street, city, postal code, state, and country. + 
Custom address fields cannot be grouped together like stock address fields (e.g. billing address) 
|*Checkbox*|Creates a checkbox for data fields with a Yes/No action 
|*Currency*|Creates a field to enter a currency value. The system automatically creates a dropdown of the currency type if the field does not already exist in that module 
|*Date*|Creates a field to enter a date. Includes a button for a calendar popup 
|*DateTime*|Creates a field to enter the date and time. Includes a Calendar icon button to choose a date via the popup calendar, as well as a dropdown list to select the time 
|*Decimal*|Creates a field to hold a number rounded to a specified decimal precision. SuiteCRM stores the exact representation of the number in the database (e.g. For a precision of 2: 2.539 is stored as 2.60) 
|*DropDown*|Creates a field where you can associate a dropdown list of values 
|*DynamicDropdown*|Creates a dropdown list from which you can relate a single record from a variety of modules. 
|*Flex Relate*|To specify a one-to-many relationship with another module, but allows linking to several kinds of modules. For example, Notes use a Flex Relate so they can be related to Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc. Only one Flex Relate-type field is allowed per module, which explains why you can't add another field of this kind to the Accounts, Calls, Meetings, Notes, and Tasks modules. 
|*Float*|Creates a field to hold a number rounded to a specified decimal precision. SuiteCRM stores the value differently based on the database platform SuiteCRM is running on 
|*HTML*|Creates static HTML-formatted text to display in record views 
|*IFrame*|Creates a field to store a URL to display in an iFrame in record views. This URL can also be generated dynamically from data in other fields.
|*Image*|Creates an image field to upload an image to display on a record 
|*Integer*|Creates a field to specify positive or negative numbers with no decimal places 
|*Multiselect*|Creates a dropdown list of values where multiple values can be selected at once 
|*Phone*|Creates a field to enter a phone number 
|*Radio*|Creates a radio button for a user to select one value from a dropdown list 
|*Relate*|Creates a field to associate a record with another module's record as a one-way relationship. You can add multiple Relate fields to a module. + 
Relate fields and custom relationships are independent of each other. Changes made to either one are not reflected in the other. Relate fields can be added to a report, but any data on the related record cannot be accessed in the report. To access related record data in a report you will need to create a custom relationship 
|*TextArea*|Creates an open text area field for multiple lines of text 
|*URL*|Creates a field to store a URL and display as a clickable link. This URL can also be generated dynamically from data in other fields.
|*TextField*|Creates a field for a single line of text 
|===

==== Adding A Dropdown Field

When adding a field of type DropDown, you need to additionally specify the
dropdown list. This contains the list items which will be displayed for the dropdown.
image:StudioFieldsAddDropDown5.png["studio - add a dropdown field"]

You can select an existing dropdown list if appropriate, or click btn:[ADD] to create a 
new one.

image:StudioFieldsAddDropDown2.png["studio - add a dropdown field"]

For each item to include in the list, enter:

[cols = "20, 80", frame = "none", grid = "none"]
|===
|*Item Name*|Used to refer to the dropdown item in the code, this must be alphanumeric, begin 
with a letter and contain no spaces. 
|*Display Name*|The text shown to the user. This may contain spaces and special characters
|===

Click btn:[ADD] to add each new entry.

To add a blank item, click btn:[ADD] without entering any values for the Item Name and the Display Label. 
It is not possible to add a blank name, but with a non-blank label.

The list can be optionally sorted alphabetically by the Display Label by clicking the appropriate
btn:[SORT] button. If you want to set a default item, this is not the place to configure that; instead, look for a 
"default value" option in the settings for the field that will be using this dropdown.

Click btn:[SAVE] to save the new dropdown list and return to the field properties. 

The dropdown list items you have created will now be visible. If desired, you can select 
a default value for the dropdown.

==== Editing A Field

Click on a field to view the field's properties. These can be edited in the same way as detailed 
above for adding a new field.

==== Deleting A Field

Only fields that have been created in Studio can be deleted via Studio. Core fields cannot be deleted.

Select the field you wish to delete and click btn:[DELETE] A warning message will appear asking you to 
confirm the deletion as both the field and any data related to the custom field will be deleted from the 
database and the field will no longer appear on any module views.

image:StudioFieldsDeleteField.png["studio - delete field "]

=== Relationships

A relationship represents a two-way link between two modules. Selecting the Relationships component 
displays all the relationships between the currently selected module
and other deployed modules.

image:StudioRelationships.png["studio - module relationships"]

Click on a relationship to view the relationship properties. 

Click btn:[ADD RELATIONSHIP] to add a new relationship for the selected module.

image:StudioAddRelationship.png["studio - add relationship"]

The *Primary Module* will be set to the currently selected module. 

Specify the relationship type:

*One to One*

With a One-to-One relationship, each record in the primary module may only have one related record in 
the related module, and vice versa. This type of relationship will add a relate field to both 
modules' records.

*One to Many*

With a One-To-Many relationship, records in the primary module may be related to one or more records 
in the related module, but each related module record is only related to one primary module record.
This will add a relate field to the related module's records, but the primary module will display 
a subpanel where more than one related module records can be added.

*Many to Many*

With a Many-To-Many relationship, records in the primary module can be related to one or more records 
in the related module, and vice versa. Each module's records will contain a subpanel for the related records.

Select the *Related Module* from the dropdown list.

Where there are subpanels, subpanel views for the module(s) can be selected. 

Click btn:[SAVE AND DEPLOY] to save the relationship.

=== Layouts

Layouts can be edited in Studio to customise the module views shown to users. 

==== Edit View

Edit view is displayed when editing a record or creating a new one.

image:StudioEditView.png["studio - edit view"]

The current layout is displayed in the main panel on the right-hand side.
Unused fields are shown in the list on the left hand side.

{{% notice tip%}}Select *Sync to Detail View* if you wish any changes made to fields or field placement 
to be automatically applied to the corresponding Detail View. Note that 
layout changes cannot be made to the Detail View when this option is set. {{%/notice%}}

*Adding Fields*

Fields can be added to the view either as a new row in an existing panel (section),
or by adding a new panel.

Click and drag the *New Row* or *New Panel* element to the desired location in the layout
on the right-hand side.

image:StudioEditViewAddPanel.png["studio - add panel to view"]

If you have added a new panel, this can be renamed by clicking the pencil icon. 
This will open the edit view for the panel label. Edit the label and click btn:[SAVE]
to return to the layout.

image:StudioEditViewRenamePanel.png["studio - rename panel"]

A new row will automatically be created with two columns.

Drag and drop the required fields to the new row. Clicking the + button will span the field
across both columns. 

Click btn:[SAVE AND DEPLOY] to save the layout changes. These should now be visible when
you navigate to the Edit view for the module.

*Deleting Fields*

Delete fields, row or panels from the layout by dragging them to the Delete area on the left-hand side.

Click btn:[SAVE AND DEPLOY] to save the layout changes. 

==== Detail View

Detail View is a read-only view, shown when a record is opened.

The Detail View layout can be edited in exactly the same way as for the Edit View. Note that if you have
*Sync to Detail View* selected on the Edit View, you will not be able to make changes to the Detail View.

==== List View

The List View is shown when a module is opened, and lists all the records in the module. 

Customise which fields are shown in the list view, and the order in which they are displayed here.

[cols = "20, 80", frame = "none", grid = "none"]
|===
|*Default*| Fields in this column will be shown by default in the list view. Re-order by dragging and dropping
the field names.
|*Available*|Fields in this column are available for users to add to the list view using the Column Chooser 
button on the list view. 
|*Hidden*|These fields are hidden from users and cannot be added to the view.
|===

Drag and drop the module fields between the columns to customise the list view.

=== Subpanels

Use this section to customise which fields are shown on a particular subpanel.

Select the subpanel. Fields shown in the Default column will be shown on the subpanel. Drag and 
drop the required fields between the two columns.

Click btn:[SAVE & DEPLOY]
