= 5. Views

SuiteCRM follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and as such has
the concept of views. Views are responsible for gathering and displaying
data . There are a number of default views in SuiteCRM. These include:

*ListView*::
  Displays a list of records and provides links to the EditViews and
  DetailViews of those records. The ListView also allows some operations
  such as deleting and mass updating records. This is (usually) the
  default view for a module.
*DetailView*::
  Displays the details of a single record and also displays subpanels of
  related records.
*EditView*::
  The EditView allows editing the various fields of a record and
  provides validation on these values.

== Location

Views can be found in `modules/<TheModule>/views/` or, for custom
views, `custom/modules/<TheModule>/views/`, and are named in the following
format: `view.<viewname>.php`. For example, the Accounts DetailView can
be found in `modules/Accounts/views/view.detail.php` with a customised
version in `custom/modules/Accounts/views/view.detail.php`. The custom
version is used if it exists. If it doesn’t then the module version is
used. Finally, if neither of these exist then the SuiteCRM default is
used in `include/MVC/View/views/`.

== Customising

In order to customise a View we first need to create the appropriate
view file. This will vary depending on the module we wish to target.

=== Custom module

In this case we can place the file directly into our module. Create a
new file (if it doesn’t exist) at
`modules/<TheModule>/views/view.<viewname>.php`. The contents will look
similar to:

.Example 5.1: View for a custom module
[source,php]
----
<?php

require_once 'include/MVC/View/views/view.<viewname>.php';

if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
class <TheModule>View<ViewName> extends View<ViewName>
{

}
----



A more concrete example would be for the detail view for a custom module
called ABC_Vehicles:

.Example 5.2: Detail view for a custom module, ABC_Vehicles
[source,php]
----
<?php

require_once 'include/MVC/View/views/view.detail.php';

if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
class ABC_VehiclesViewDetail extends ViewDetail
{

}
----



=== Preexisting modules

For preexisting modules you will want to add the view to +
`custom/modules/<TheModule>/views/view.<viewname>.php`.

The contents of this file will vary depending on whether you wish to
extend the existing view (if it exists) or create your own version
completely. It is usually best to extend the existing view, since this
will retain important logic. Note the naming convention here. We name
the class `Custom<TheModule>View<ViewName>` (for example
`CustomAccountsViewDetail`).

Here we don’t extend the existing view or no such view exists:

.Example 5.3: Custom view for an existing module
[source,php]
----
<?php
if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');

require_once 'include/MVC/View/views/view.<viewname>.php';

class Custom<TheModule>View<ViewName> extends ViewDetail
{

}
----



Otherwise we extend the existing view. Note that we are requiring the
existing view:

.Example 5.4: Overriding a view for an existing module
[source,php]
----
<?php
if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');

require_once 'modules/<TheModule>/views/view.<viewname>.php';

class Custom<TheModule>View<ViewName> extends <TheModule>View<ViewName>
{

}
----



For example, overriding the List View of Accounts:

.Example 5.5: Overriding the Accounts List View
[source,php]
----
<?php
if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');

require_once 'modules/Accounts/views/view.list.php';

class CustomAccountsViewList extends AccountsViewList
{

}
----



=== Making changes

Now that we have a custom view what can we actually do? The views have
various methods which we can now override to change/add behaviour. The
most common ones to override are:

`preDisplay`::
  Explicitly intended to allow logic to be called before display() is
  called. This can be used to alter arguments to the list view or to
  output anything to appear before the main display code (such as, for
  example, adding JavaScript).
`display`::
  Does the actual work of displaying the view. Can be overridden to
  alter this behaviour or to output anything after the main display. You
  usually want to call parent::display(); to ensure that the display
  code is run (unless, of course, you are adding your own display
  logic). link:../views


=== Customising with Smarty templates

Instead of using including HTML files in PHP, you can use Smarty templates to create complex HTML for custom views.

Let's say you're adding a custom module called `Store`, and you've made a file at `custom/modules/Store/views/view.store.php` that uses HTML in HEREDOCs and Strings to create a dynamic page:

[source,php]
----------
<?php
if (!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');

require_once('include/MVC/View/SugarView.php');

class StoreView extends SugarView
{
    public function display()
    {
        $storeName = $store->storeName;
        $location = $store->location;
        $products = $store->products;

        $html = <<<"HTML"
<h1>$storeName</h1>
<h2>Location: $location</h2>

<ul>
HTML;

        foreach ($products as $id => $product) {
            $html .= "<li>$product->name: $product->price</li>";
        }

        $html .= <<<"HTML"
</ul>
HTML;

        echo $html;
    }
}
----------

This works, but it isn't very nice to look at, and it's hard to maintain and understand. You're combining your backend logic with the frontend HTML, which we should try to avoid as much as possible.

Instead, we can accomplish the same thing using a Smarty template. We can change the `custom/modules/Store/views/view.store.php` file to just provide the variables for the Smarty template, instead of creating the HTML itself.

[source,php]
----------
<?php
if (!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');

require_once('include/MVC/View/SugarView.php');

class StoreView extends SugarView
{
    public function display()
    {
        $smarty = new Sugar_Smarty();
        $smarty->assign('storeName', $store->storeName);
        $smarty->assign('location', $store->location);
        $smarty->assign('products', $store->products);
        $storePage = $smarty->fetch('custom/modules/Store/templates/store.tpl');
        return $storePage;
    }
}
----------

And then we'll create a file at `custom/modules/Store/templates/store.tpl`, that looks like this:

[source,html]
----------
<h1>{$storeName}</h1>
<h2>Location: {$location}</h2>

<ul>
    {foreach name=productsIteration from=$products key=id item=product}
        <li>{$product->name}: {$product->price}</li>
    {/foreach}
</ul>
----------

Much simpler!
