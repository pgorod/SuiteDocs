== Uninstalling a SuiteCRM instance

Follow these steps to uninstall your SuiteCRM instance:

.  Navigate to the directory within your web server where SuiteCRM is
located.
.  Remove the SuiteCRM directory(Linux: rm -r <suitedirectory> if you
wish to be prompted, rm -rf <suitedirectory> if you wish to delete the
directory without being prompted).
.  Delete the SuiteCRM database schema from your server
database(default is “suitecrm”, this will differ if this has been
renamed during the installation process)..
