===== Potential breaking change with Smarty

If you maintain a custom SuiteCRM theme, you should note that this release may require some small changes to your `.tpl` Smarty files. This is because of a legacy customization to Smarty that was removed when it was moved to inclusion via Composer.

The only breaking change will be if you've used the `theme_template` attribute for any Smarty ``include``s. You'll need to remove the `theme_template` attribute and change the file attribute to use the full path:

[source,html]
----
{* before *}
{ include file="_head.tpl" theme_template=true }

{* after *}
{ include file="themes/SuiteP/tpls/_head.tpl" }
----

Plugin files are still usable in the same way as before – at `./include/Smarty/plugins/` – and can be ``require``d explicitly. Custom plugins should still go in `./custom/include/Smarty/plugins/`. It should be noted that all other files in `./include/Smarty` have been replaced by empty files to prevent errors in case users were `require`ing the files. They're deprecated, and requires referencing them can be safely removed. Smarty's internal files will be autoloaded by Composer by default.

== 7.10 Release Candidate 2

=== Assets

* https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/archive/v7.10-RC-2.zip[*Source code* (zip)]
* https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/archive/v7.10-RC-2.tar.gz[*Source code* (tar.gz)]

=== Release Notes

In order to facilitate European GDPR compliance, SuiteCRM 7.10 introduces two Opt-In settings,
Opt-In and Confirmed-Opt-In.

1. Opt In is used to indicate that a Contact, Lead or Target has opted in to receive marketing communications.

2. Confirmed Opt In further requires users to confirm their opt-in status by clicking a link sent to them
via email. This email can be configured to send automa cally (e.g. on submission of a Web-To-Person form) or manually,
and the template used to send this email can be customised.

*You can read more about this new feature link:/user/modules/confirmed-opt-in-settings/[here].*

Download https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/releases/tag/v7.9.13[here] from the SuiteCRM GitHub Repository
or https://suitecrm.com/download[visit the official website] to find the appropriate upgrade.

We have also updated our Security Process asking the community to send their security issues directly to us
via email security@suitecrm.com.
