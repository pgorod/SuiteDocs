= PDF Template

This module allows you to create document templates.
In the future, based on these templates, PDF documents or emails can be created,
in which the necessary data from SuiteCRM will automatically be added during the merge process.

Load Sample:: The system Quotes several options for ready-made templates, if necessary.
Active :: An option that determines whether the current template will be offered in the
list of templates when creating a document (see the section below, Creating PDF Documents Based on a Template),
Page Size/ Orientation:: If necessary, select the size and orientation of the template page.
Then default is A4 size and portrait page orientation.
Inserting into a Field::  This option allows you to add the necessary variable to the template,
which later (in the process of creating a document based template)
will be replaced with the necessary data from the SuiteCRM+
To insert a variable: :::
*	In the left combo box, select the module from which you want to get information.
*	In the middle combo box, select the name of the field of the selected module,
then the name of the necessary variable corresponding to the selected field so it appears in the right field.
*	In the text of the template, specify the place where the selected variable should be added and click the button btn:[Insert]

The following picture shows an example of adding the variable *$aos_invoices_number*,
which, when creating the document based on the current template,
will be automatically replaced with the account number.

If it is necessary to add data in the template, for example,
listing positions in the Offer or Invoice,
then such data should be arranged in a table:

If several templates were created for the current module,
they will be presented in the form of a list,
from which you need to select the desired position :

then the necessary document will be immediately created on its basis.
