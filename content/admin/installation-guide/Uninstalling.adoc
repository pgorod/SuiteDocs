== Uninstalling a SuiteCRM instance

Follow these steps to uninstall your SuiteCRM instance:

.  Navigate to the directory within your web server where SuiteCRM is
located.
.  Remove the SuiteCRM directory. In Linux, you can use `rm -r <suitedirectory>` if you
wish to be prompted, or `rm -rf <suitedirectory>` if you wish to delete the
directory without being prompted.
.  Delete the SuiteCRM database schema from your server
database. The default is `suitecrm`, but it will differ if it has been
renamed during the installation process.
