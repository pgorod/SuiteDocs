= Users

== Overview

This guide documents the settings on the Users section of the Administration panel.

A *user* represents someone who can log in to your *SuiteCRM* system. 
In addition to the basic information (name, title, address, phone number etc) 
contained in the *Employees* module, a user has a username and password 
to enable them to log in to the system, and an email address. When a new User 
is created in SuiteCRM, a matching Employee record is created. Similarly, when a 
new Employee record is created, a new User record is also created. 
This new user record will need to be edited (if required) to add a username/password 
and email address before it can be used to log in to *SuiteCRM*.

The *Users* section of the *Administration Panel* holds settings for *SuiteCRM* 
user accounts and security access settings. 

{{%notice note %}}You must have Administrator access to add new user accounts and 
edit access settings. Regular users have access to their own user account details 
and can edit address details, set preferences, set up personal email and change 
their password.{{% /notice %}}

Open the Administration panel by selecting *Admin* from the dropdown at the top 
right-hand of the *SuiteCRM* screen.

On the default *User Profile* tab, enter the new username, user's first and last 
names and the account status (Active or Inactive). 

{{%notice info %}}Only *Active* accounts can be used to log in to *SuiteCRM*. 
In addition, *Inactive* account usernames are not included in dropdown username 
lists (e.g. assigned to or modified by lists) used for record searching.{{% /notice %}}

Select the User Type from the drop down. A System Administrator User can 
access the Administration panel and all records in *SuiteCRM*. A regular user 
has access to modules and records based on the role(s) assigned to them. See
link:../roles-and-security-groups[Roles and Security Groups] for further 
information.

An optional photograph can be attached to the user record. Browse for the required 
file using the btn:[Choose file] button. The photo will be displayed on the detail 
view of the user record once the record has been saved.
