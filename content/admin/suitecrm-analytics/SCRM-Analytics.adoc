= SuiteCRM Web Analytics

SuiteCRM Web Analytics is a web based analysis and reporting frontend that allows users to explore data 
in the Data Warehouse that has been extracted from SuiteCRM and third party data sources.

Users are able to log into the web portal to run, filter data or schedule reports. The web portal provides 
the ability to import new reports and dashboards created using Pentaho powerful CTools and Report Designer. 
Reports can support a number of different visual charts and output types such as HTML, PDF and Excel.

{{% /notice %}}

There are two ways of downloading the SuiteCRM Web Analytics.

* https://suitecrm.com/resources/suitecrm-analytics-tool[Download from SuiteCRM website^]: a pre-built 
package containing installation scripts, web server and all the third party open source libraries required.
* Clone the SuiteCRM Web Analytics repo: a script to build the SuiteCRM web analytics package 
(generating the same available package via the SuiteCRM website).

=== Manually Build the package (cloning from repo)

Clone repo via terminal:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/ivylabs/suitecrm-analytics
----

Navigate into the newly cloned repository's directory and run build.sh

[source,bash]
----
./build.sh
----

This should output on your terminal all the files that the solution downloads and zips up into a package.
The end of the script will ask if you wish to delete the installation files.

[source,bash]
----
Would you like to remove the installation files? This will save disk space. [y/N] y

-------------------------------------------------------------

 Build is complete!

-------------------------------------------------------------
----

This will generate a package named **suitecrm-analytics-server.zip** within the root of your directory. 
This is the same package available via the SuiteCRM website.


=== Configuring SuiteCRM Data Integration

After downloading or generating the `suitecrm-analytics-server.zipÂ´ file, **Upload** and **extract** this 
file on a hosted web server.

Navigate into the newly extracted `suitecrm-analytics-server` folder and edit the `install.properties`.

[source,bash]
----
JVM_SIZE=1024
SUITECRM_HOST=127.0.0.1
SUITECRM_PORT=3306
SUITECRM_DATABASE=suitecrm_testdata
SUITECRM_USERNAME=suitecrmrootuser
SUITECRM_PASSWORD=suitecrmrootuserpassword
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_HOST=127.0.0.1
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_PORT=3306
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_DATABASE=suitecrm_dwh
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_USERNAME=suitecrmrootuser
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_PASSWORD=suitecrmrootuserpassword
# DO NOT CHANGE FROM PORT 8080! There is a bug with uploading the solution when the port is changed
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_WEBAPP_PORT=8080
----

These config variables define the connection to your SuiteCRM database to extract information from.

[source,bash]
----
# SuiteCRM Source Database Connection Details
SUITECRM_HOST=127.0.0.1
SUITECRM_PORT=3306
SUITECRM_DATABASE=suitecrm_testdata
SUITECRM_USERNAME=suitecrmrootuser
SUITECRM_PASSWORD=suitecrmrootuserpassword
----

These config variables define the connection to your SuiteCRM data warehouse (created by the 
SuiteCRM Data Integration solution) to retrieve your transformed SuiteCRM data.

[source,bash]
----
# SuiteCRM Analytis Target Database Connection
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_HOST=127.0.0.1
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_PORT=3306
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_DATABASE=suitecrm_dwh
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_USERNAME=suitecrmrootuser
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_PASSWORD=suitecrmrootuserpassword
----

=== Installing SuiteCRM Web Analytics

Once the configuration has been defined, now run the setup script within the same root directory of 
your suitecrm-analytics-server.

[source,bash]
----
./setup-suitecrm-analytics.sh
----

This will check that the web server can successfully run and the database connections are successful.

Then you can run the SuiteCRM Web Analytics web server to access the application.

[source,bash]
----
./start-suitecrm-analytics.sh
----

This should output on your terminal that the tomcat server has started.

To follow the web server logs you can run this command:

[source,bash]
----
tail -f tomcat/logs/catalina.out
----

To confirm the server has successfully started look for the following line in the above log file 
with `N` as a dynamic number depending on how quickly the server initialised.

[source,bash]
----
org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in N ms
----

Once the server has initialised you can log into the SuiteCRM Analytics Web Application by navigating 
to the hostname or IP address of the server in your web browser.
By default the web application is listening on port `8080` so for example, your server may be 
available on `http://localhost:8080/suitecrmanalytics`.
