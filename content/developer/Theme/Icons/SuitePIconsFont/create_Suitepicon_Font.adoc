Since 7.9, SuiteCRM has a new font called suitepicon which takes all the icons of SuiteP and turns them into a font. Then means that you can easily change the colors and styling of the icons while keeping them in an optimised format.

To use the icons you need to specify the css classes which are defined in the font:

....
<span class="suitepicon action-first"></span>
....

*Locations:*

* themes/SuiteP/css/suitepicon.eot
* themes/SuiteP/css/suitepicon.html
* themes/SuiteP/css/suitepicon.json
* themes/SuiteP/css/suitepicon.scss
* themes/SuiteP/css/suitepicon.svg
* themes/SuiteP/css/suitepicon.ttf
* themes/SuiteP/css/suitepicon.woff
* themes/SuiteP/css/suitepicon-glyphs.scss

The goal of this project is to turn the icons in the SuiteCRM suitep theme into a font. As this will provide better optimisation and control over how the the https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteP-Icon-Font[suitep] theme looks.
