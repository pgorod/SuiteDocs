=== Release Notes

*Upgraded Sugar to 6.5.17*

SugarCRM have not released an official list of fixes, but thanks to Matthew Poer we have been able to list some fixes between SugarCRM 6.5.16 and 6.5.17:

* When sending an email, the Asynchronous request is sent via POST instead of GET.
* Module loader's security scanner now blocks simplexml_load_file and simplexml_load_string.
* The RSS dashlet replaces a function that once used simplexml_load_file with a new set of commands that replicate the functionality, but more (I presume) more securely.
* Quick Search can no longer be configured to search against users.user_hash (the user passwords).
* Minor bugfix in modules/Users/controller.php, a new save function to help it support a different server environment.
* Modules/Users/Save.php adjusted to further ensure that non-admins cannot adjust settings for other users.

6.5.17 introduces an important security patch.
