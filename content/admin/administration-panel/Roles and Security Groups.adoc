= Roles and Security Groups

Roles and Security Group settings are managed from the *Users* section of the *Administration Panel*.

The settings allows you to restrict access to sensitive data in *SuiteCRM* 
to specific teams (groups). There are many options to allow you to configure it
to your exact needs, and a number of automatic assignment
options to ensure that your users can always access the data that they
need. 

*Security Groups* allow you to define groups of users with particular access rights 
defined by the roles attached to the group. Groups can also be used to assign records to teams 
of users.

*Roles* are used to define access rights to modules and determine what a 
user can do with a record once they have access to it.

There are 3 key steps to setting up Groups so that you work correctly.

1.  Create a *group* for each team of users and add the appropriate users
to the group.
2.  Create a *role* and select the appropriate access levels. Assign that role to each group.
3.  Add the groups to records in your SuiteCRM instance. You can use the
Mass Assign on the List View to do this. Going forward the groups will
automatically inherit based on your SecuritySuite Settings. You can also
use logic hooks, workflow, or do a direct database insert into the
securitygroups_records table if doing a one-time initial setup.

{{%notice info%}}Further advanced security group settings and functionality are available with 
the purchase of the https://store.suitecrm.com/addons/securitysuite[SecuritySuite^] 
add-on{{%/notice%}}

== Role Management

Create a role to define access to modules and the functions users will be able to
perform on records within these modules. The role can then be assigned to security groups
or to individual users where appropriate. 

=== Create Role

Select Role Management, and then Create Role from the Role Management sidebar.

image:RolesSidebar.png["Roles sidebar"]

Enter a name and a description for the role you are creating and click btn:[SAVE]

image:RolesCreateRole.png["Create New Role"]

Once the role has been created, the role matrix will be displayed, showing all the
configurable access options for each module. 

image:RolesMatrix.png["Roles - access matrix"]

Click on a cell to change the access setting. Note that you can change the setting 
for an entire column by clicking on the column heading.

image:RolesSetModuleAccess.png["Roles - access matrix"]

Use the *Access* column to determine whether users can access each module:

[cols="20,80",frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|*Enabled*| Users have access to this module
|*Disabled*| Users will not be able to view records for this module.
|===

Use the *Delete*, *Edit*, *Export* , *Import*, *List*, *Mass Update* and *View* columns
to determine available record functions for users:

[cols="20,80",frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|*Group* |Gives users access to all records assigned to members of the same
group.
|*Owner* |Gives users access only to their own records.
|*None* |Users will not have access to this function for this module.
|===

Click btn:[SAVE] Once saved, access rights are color coded for ease of reading.

{{%notice tip%}}If your users should only typically see their own records 
then the role you would assign to their group would be configured to have 
*Owner* rights. A manager who is a part of the same group, but who should be 
able to see all records in the group should have a role directly assigned to their user
record that gives *Group* access. {{%/notice%}}

==== Add User or Group

Assign the role to a group or an individual user as appropriate, using the subpanels below 
the matrix.

=== List Roles

Select List Roles from the sidebar to view all roles and their descriptions. 

image:RolesListRoles.png["List Roles"]

Click on the role name to view and edit the access settings.

Click on the pencil icon to edit the role name and/or description.

=== List Roles by User

Select a username from the list to display the access matrix for the user as defined by all 
roles applied to the user.

image:RolesListByUser.png["List Roles by User"]

== Security Suite Management

Select *Security Suite Management* from the Admin panel to view any existing groups or create a
new group. 

=== Create Group

Create a group to define groups of users with particular access rights which are
defined by the roles attached to the group. Groups can also be used to assign records in the CRM.

Select *Security Suite Management*, and then *Create a Security Group* from the sidebar.

image:SecurityGroupsSidebar.png[title="Security Groups Sidebar"]

image:SecurityGroupsCreateGroup.png[title="Create Group"]

Enter a name and an optional description for the group. 

*Not Inheritable* If this field is checked then the group will not automatically be attached to 
any record. This can be useful for cases such as creating groups to assign roles to.

Click btn:[SAVE]

The Detail view for the newly created group will appear.

==== Add Users and Roles

Add users and roles to the group as required, using the subpanels. 

image:SecurityGroupsCreateGroup2.png[title="Create Group"]

Here, Chris and Sarah are
members of the group and the *Owner Only* role has been applied, so the *Owner Only*
role settings will apply to both Chris and Sarah.

=== View Security Groups

Select  *Security Groups* from the sidebar to view all security groups.

Click the group name to edit the users and roles attached to the group, and the pencil
icon to edit the group name and/or description.

== Security Suite Settings

SuiteCRM System Administrators can configure many advanced options for
Security Suite. This allows you to control various access rights,
inheriting of records, filters and more.

image:SecurityGroupsConfigure.png[title="Security Groups Management: Configure"]

[discrete]
==== Additive Rights

User gets greatest rights of all roles assigned to the user or the user's
group(s)

[discrete]
==== Strict Rights

If a user is a member of several groups only the respective rights from
the group assigned to the current record are used.

[discrete]
==== New User Group Popup

If this is checked, a Security Groups popup will open when a new user is created, 
allowing you to add the user to a security group(s)

[discrete]
==== User Role Precedence

If any role is assigned directly to a user that role should take
precedence over any group roles.

[discrete]
==== Filter User List

With this selected, non-admin users can only assign records to users who are in the same group(s)

[discrete]
==== Use Creator Group Select

Adds a panel to a record creation screen if a user is a member of more
than one inheritable group that allows a user to select one or more
groups (that the user belongs to) that should be associated with the newly
created record. If a user is in just one group the normal inheritance
rules will instead be applied.

{{% notice note %}}
The new record will still inherit from the Assigned To user or
Parent record if these options are set. This setting only overrides the
Created By setting.
{{% /notice %}}

[discrete]
==== Inherit from Created By User

The record will inherit all the groups assigned to the user who created it.

[discrete]
==== Inherit from Assigned To User

The record will inherit all the groups of the user assigned to the record.
{{% notice note %}}Other groups assigned to the record will NOT be removed.{{% /notice %}}

[discrete]
==== Inherit from Parent Record

E.g. If a case is created for a contact the case will inherit the groups
associated with the contact.

[discrete]
==== Inbound email account

Locks down inbound email accounts in the email client to only list those
that belong to the same group as the current user.

[discrete]
==== Default Groups for New Records

Set groups that should always be attached when a specific module record is
created, e.g. you can set a group to be assigned to all newly created Account records.
