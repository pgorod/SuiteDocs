== Enabling Desktop Notifications

You can enable desktop notifications by accessing the *'Advanced'* tab
within your user preferences. This will enable desktop notifications
only for that browser on that computer. You can choose to enable the
desktop notifications just for that browser session, or to always enable
desktop notifications.

Users will have to enable desktop notifications on all browsers
and computers if you use more than one.

Once desktop notifications have been enabled, users will receive
notifications for any Calendar events such as:

* *Meetings* – Meetings you have been invited to that have popup reminders
set.
* *Calls* – Calls you have been invited to that have popup reminders set.

== Managing Desktop Notifications

If you have no notifications, the notification count will show '0' to
tell you you currently have no notifications to check.

If you do not click on a desktop notification when it is displayed in
the browser, for example you are AFK(Away From Keyboard) your
notifications will be added to the notification list which shows as a
count on the main navigation bar.
