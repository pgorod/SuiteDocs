SuiteCRM requires Elasticsearch 5.6.
{{% /notice %}}

Elasticsearch requires Java 8 to run, supporting only `Oracle Java` and `OpenJDK`.

The quickest ways of having an Elasticsearch server up and running is by
either using the official Docker image, or the .deb package for Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu).

In this guide we will assume that you are attempting to install
Elasticsearch on an Ubuntu machine. Refer to the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/install-elasticsearch.html[official documentation]
to know how to install Elasticsearch in different ways.

This guide will teach you how to have a development server up and running with very little configuration,
either by installing via Docker or .deb package.
Please keep in mind this guide is not suitable for setting up a production Elasticsearch server.

== Install via Docker (recommended)

{{% notice note %}}
Be sure that the current user belongs to the `docker` group or you'll receive permission issues.
{{% /notice %}}

Download image:

[source,bash]
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.6.10

=== Start with `docker run`

Start Elasticsearch. This is ideal for a test/development server.

[source,bash]
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 \
-e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.6.10

=== Start with `docker-compose`

Create a new `docker-compose.yml` file or add the elasticsearch configuration your pre-existing docker-compose.

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3'
services:
    elasticsearch:
        image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.6.10
        container_name: elasticsearch
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
            - 9200:9200
            - 9300:9300
        environment:
            - discovery.type=single-node
            - xpack.security.enabled=false
            - "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
----

And start with:

[source,bash]
docker-compose up

== Install via .deb (not recommended)

Download and install the public signing key:

[source,bash]
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

You may need to install the `apt-transport-https` package on Debian before proceeding:

[source,bash]
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

Save the repository definition to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-5.x.list`:

[source,bash]
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-5.x.list

Update the repository and install OpenJDK 11 and Elasticsearch:

[source,bash]
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre elasticsearch

{{% notice note %}}
You might need to tweak the OpenJDK version to match the one available for your distribution.
{{% /notice %}}

Start Elasticsearch with:

[source,bash]
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service

or on older Ubuntus:

[source,bash]
/etc/init.d/elasticsearch start

== Test Installation

Check if the server is running with:

[source,bash]
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/"

And you should receive something like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "name" : "B5VzMdk",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "KGoWI84GQ8SZipmDaeA7pA",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "5.6.10",
    "build_hash" : "b727a60",
    "build_date" : "2018-06-06T15:48:34.860Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "6.6.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}

Note that the current setup does not provide authentication.
Remember to secure your Elasticsearch server before going to production,
or your data will be vulnerable!
