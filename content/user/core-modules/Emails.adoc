== Overview

The *Emails* module in *SuiteCRM* allows Users to view, store, compose, send and receive email 
from their own personal email account or a shared inbox, for example a Support or Sales inbox. 
Emails can be imported and associated with a related *SuiteCRM* record, for example a Contact or an Account. 
These related emails can then be viewed on the history subpanel of the related record.

{{% notice note %}}
You will need to set up and have access to at least one *personal* or *group* email account in order to use 
the *Emails* module. See link:../../introduction/managing-user-accounts#_personal_email_account_settings[Personal Email Settings] 
for information on setting up a personal email account. For information on configuring group, 
bounce handling and the system outbound mail accounts, please see 
the link:../../../admin/administration-panel/email[Emails] section of the Administrator Guide.

=== Import Mail

Email can be imported into *SuiteCRM* and associated with a relevant *SuiteCRM* record (e.g. a contact or account record). 
This can be very useful in keeping a history of communication with a client, for example.
Emails which have been imported and related to a record in *SuiteCRM* can be viewed from the record's history subpanel.

==== Import Single Email

An individual email can be imported from *Detail* view. Open the email, and then select *Import* from the *Actions* dropdown menu.

image:268bEmailsImport.png[title="Import emails"]

==== Import One or More Emails

One or more emails can be imported at the same time from *List* view. 

Select the email(s) you wish to import using the checkboxes to the left-hand side of the view. 

Select *Import* from the *Bulk Action* menu.

image:268aEmailsImport.png[title="Import emails"]

On importing, a dialog will open allowing you to select which record to relate the email(s) to. 

image:268EmailsImportDialog.png[title="Import emails"]

First select the module type from the drop-down.  Next, use the search arrow button to find and select the relevant record, 
or begin typing the name into the field and select the required record from the auto-complete list. Click the btn:[OK] button.

Note that if you are bulk importing mail, all emails will be related to the record selected here. If you need to relate mail 
to different records you will need to import these individually.

*SuiteCRM* can also be configured to automatically import emails for group mail accounts. 
See link:../../../admin/administration-panel/email/#_group_email_account[Group Email Accounts] for more information.

=== Delete Mail
As only imported emails are stored in *SuiteCRM*, only imported email records can be deleted from the *Emails* module. 

To delete an imported email record, open the email and then select Delete from the Actions menu dropdown. Note that this 
will only delete the SuiteCRM record and not the imap message. To remove emails from the Emails module, you will need to 
move or delete them using your external mail client.

== Changes To Emails Module

Prior to version 7.9, *SuiteCRM* had to synchronise the email headers before users could view them. As of 
version 7.9, *SuiteCRM* contacts the email server directly - retrieving only the minimal information needed to process an operation. 
This eliminates the synchronisation process and significantly reduces amount of email information needed to be stored in the database. 

Note to developers and administrators: The 'email_cache' table is deprecated in *SuiteCRM* 7.9.

=== Upgrading

If you are upgrading from a version of *SuiteCRM* prior to *7.9.x*, you will need to use the *Sync Inbound Email Account Tool* on 
upgrading. This tool will synchronise mail already imported into *SuiteCRM* with your current IMAP accounts so that you will not 
have to synchronise in the future. We recommend taking a backup of your database and instance before upgrading.

=== Sync Inbound Emails Accounts Tool

From the *Admin* panel, select *Repair* and then *Sync Inbound Email Accounts*.
image:SyncInboundEmailAccounts.png[Sync Inbound Email Accounts]

This will display a multiple selection box *Mail Account Name* listing all of the active inbound email accounts
(including personal accounts) and a btn:[SYNC] button.

[cols="20,80",frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|image:SyncInboundEmailAccounts2.png[Select accounts to sync]
|Select the required accounts from the multiple selection box (use *ctrl + click* to select more than one) and click btn:[SYNC]. 
|===

The page will refresh and list the progression of the tool.

The tool goes through all the selected inbound email accounts and updates them to support new features in *SuiteCRM* 7.9 onwards:

* Connects to the email server (via IMAP)
* Downloads the email header information
* Determines the orphaned status of emails
* Updates the unique ID for each email
* Corrects synchronisation problems

If an error occurs, you can run the tool on the other accounts which are working. The details of any errors can be found in the suitecrm.log file.
