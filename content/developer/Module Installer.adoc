= 15. Module Installer

As detailed in the other chapters of this book there are many ways to
customise SuiteCRM. The module installer allows you to package these
changes and install them onto other SuiteCRM instances. This is achieved
by creating a package.

At the minimum a package is a zip file that contains a `manifest.php`
file in it’s root. The manifest file is responsible for providing
information about the installer as well as providing information on how
to install the package.

== manifest.php

The `manifest.php` file contains the definition of three arrays. Let’s
look at each of these arrays in turn. See below for a full sample
`manifest.php` file.

{{% notice info %}}
Within path
in the manifest file you can use `<basepath>` to refer to the base
directory of the installer. For example `<basepath>/Foo.txt` will refer
to the `Foo.txt` file in the root of the installer package.
{{% /notice %}}

`$manifest` ::
The `$manifest` array provides information on the package itself such as
it’s name, readme etc. (it also defines the `copy` array for `patch`
packages). A sample definition of the manifest array will appear
something like this:

.Example 15.1: Example $manifest array definition
[source,php]
----
$manifest = array(
   'name' => 'My First Package',
   'description' => 'This is a simple package example manifest file',
   'version' => '1.5',
   'author' => 'Jim Mackin',
   'readme' => 'readme.txt',
   'acceptable_sugar_flavors' => array('CE'),
   'acceptable_sugar_versions' => array(
     'exact_matches' => array(),
     'regex_matches' => array('6\.5\.[0-9]$'),
   ),
   'copy_files' => array (
     'from_dir' => '<basepath>/custom/',    
     'to_dir' => 'custom',     
     'force_copy' => array (),
   ),
   'dependencies' => array(
     array(
       'id_name' => 'example_dependency_package',
       'version' => '2.4',
     ),
   ),
);
----



`name`::
  The name of the package. This is how the package will appear to the
  user during installation and in the Module Loader package list. The
  package name is required.
`description`::
  A brief description of the package.
`version`::
  The version of this package. This can be any string but is usually a
  traditional version number (such as `3.1.4`).
`author`::
  The author of the package.
`readme`::
  A brief readme string. Note that if a `README.txt` is found in the
  root of the package this will be used instead.
`acceptable_sugar_flavors`::
  A remnant of the SugarCRM packages. This should always be an array
  with (at least) a `CE` entry. If you would like the installer to
  target both SuiteCRM and SugarCRM editions then this can contain one
  of the other SugarCRM flavours (`PRO`, `CORP` , `ULT` or `ENT`).
`acceptable_sugar_versions`::
  An array detailing the matching SugarCRM versions. Note that the
  SugarCRM version is distinct from the SuiteCRM version. This array has
  two keys. `exact_matches` is simply an array of the allowed versions.
  `regex_matches` allows specifying regexes to match versions. For
  SuiteCRM you only need to worry about supporting the `6.5.*` versions
  which can be matched with the regex `6\.5\.[0-9]$`. At the time of
  writing the current SugarCRM version for SuiteCRM is `6.5.20`.
`copy_files`::
  This is only used for `patch` installers and will copy files in the
  `from_dir` key to those in the `to_dir` key. Finally the `force_copy`
  key can be used to specify files that should be forcibly copied over.
`dependencies`::
  An array of other packages that are relied on by this package. Each
  entry is an array with `id_name` - the id of the package and `version` the required version of the package.
`icon`::
  The path (within the installer) to an icon to be displayed during
  installation.
`is_uninstallable`::
  Whether or not uninstalls should be allowed.
`published_date`::
  The date that the package was published. There is no fixed format for
  the date, it is simply a string.
`key`::
  Specifies a key to ensure that modules do not clash. This will prefix
  the installed modules and tables with `key`. This is used by the
  module builder when creating packages but can be specified if you
  wish.
`remove_tables`::
  A string specifying whether module tables should be removed when
  uninstalling this package. Accepted values are `true`, `false` and
  `prompt`. The default is `true`.
`type`::
  The type of the installer, one of `langpack`, `module`, `patch` or
  `theme`. See the types section.
