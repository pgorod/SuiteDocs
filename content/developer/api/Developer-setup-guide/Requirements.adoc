In order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the authorization server
MUST require the use of TLS with server authentication as defined by
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818[RFC2818] for any request sent to the
authorization and token endpoints. The client MUST validate the
authorization serverâ€™s TLS certificate as defined by
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125[RFC6125] and in accordance with its
requirements for server identity authentication.

SuiteCRM uses key cryptography in order to encrypt and decrypt, as well
as verify the integrity of signatures.

Please ensure that you have the following:

* OpenSSL PHP Extension installed and configured
* The SuiteCRM instance must be configured to use HTTPS/SSL
* You need to have PHP version 5.5.9, or 7.0 and above

To be able to successfully connect to the endpoints, you need to complete the steps under section
