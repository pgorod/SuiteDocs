===== Potential breaking change with Smarty

If you maintain a custom SuiteCRM theme, you should note that this release may require some small changes to your `.tpl` Smarty files. This is because of a legacy customization to Smarty that was removed when it was moved to inclusion via Composer.

The only breaking change will be if you've used the `theme_template` attribute for any Smarty ``include``s. You'll need to remove the `theme_template` attribute and change the file attribute to use the full path:

[source,html]
----
{* before *}
{ include file="_head.tpl" theme_template=true }

{* after *}
{ include file="themes/SuiteP/tpls/_head.tpl" }
----

Plugin files are still usable in the same way as before – at `./include/Smarty/plugins/` – and can be ``require``d explicitly. Custom plugins should still go in `./custom/include/Smarty/plugins/`. It should be noted that all other files in `./include/Smarty` have been replaced by empty files to prevent errors in case users were `require`ing the files. They're deprecated, and requires referencing them can be safely removed. Smarty's internal files will be autoloaded by Composer by default.
