production system.

=== Upgrading to SuiteCRM from SugarCRM Community Edition

Upgrade paths are available for SugarCRM to SuiteCRM from the SuiteCRM
downloads section of the SuiteCRM website. To validate what versions of
SugarCRM are compatible with the respective SuiteCRM versions, please
check the table below: SuiteCRM Version SugarCRM Version SuiteCRM 7.0.1
SugarCRM 6.5.x SuiteCRM 7.0.0 SugarCRM 6.5.x

=== Upgrade prerequisites

* Backup your current SuiteCRM directory and database before beginning
the upgrade process.
* Disable op-code caching before upgrading your SuiteCRM installation if
op-code caching is enabled in the PHP configuration file. You can enable
it after the upgrade process is complete.
* Increase the default value of the parameters listed below before you
begin the upgrade process if you are using Zend Core 2.0:
** Navigate to C:\Program Files\Zend\Core\etc\fastcgi.conf and increase
the default value for ConnectionTimeout to 3000 seconds and
RequestTimeout to 6000 seconds.
** Navigate to the php.ini file and increase the default value of
max_execution_time to 6000 seconds.
* Perform the following for the large size of the upgrade files:
** Modify and save the value of Maximum upload size to 30000000 (30MB)
in the Advanced section of the System Settings page of your current
SuiteCRM installation.
** Navigate to the php.ini file on your web server and configure the
parameters listed below in the Advanced section of the System Settings
page of your current SuiteCRM installation:
*** Set post_max_size to at least 60MB
*** Set upload_max_filesize settings to at least 60MB
*** Set max_input_time to a large number
*** Set memory_limit to 256MB

Restart the web server and begin the upgrade process.

* Ensure that LimitRequestBody is set to a large number or use the
default value of 2GB if you are using an Apache web server and
LimitRequestBody is set in the httpd.conffile. Restart Apache and begin
the upgrade process.
* Ensure that the webserver user has write permissions to the SuiteCRM
database. The upgrade to SuiteCRM 7.0.x will add and replace files in
several locations including the SuiteCRM root directory. The webserver
user must have write permissions for the root folder and all
sub-directories during the upgrade process.
* The process of upgrading can take up to 30 minutes. Set the CGI script
timeout to more than the default 300 seconds to ensure that the CGI
application does not time out if you are using the IIS web server.
* Save PHP files for customized modules (for example, accounts.php) in
the Customs directory and not within the main module. Existing
customizations may be overridden by changes in SuiteCRM 7.0.x during
upgrade.

=== Upgrade considerations

The Dynamic Teams feature requires some database schema changes across
all modules as part of the upgrade process. For larger databases, this
operation can take some time to complete. Follow the steps listed below
to ensure a smooth upgrade process:

1.  Test your upgrade on a development instance instead of the
production instance.
2.  Use the Silent Upgrade method through the command line interface to
conduct the upgrade instead of the Upgrade Wizard inside the application
if your database contains more than 10000 records per table.
3.  Log into the application as an Administrator and use the Repair
option to repair and rebuild the database after the upgrade is complete.

== Perform update

The update can be done in the following ways:

 . Using the link:../using-the-upgrade-wizard[Upgrade Wizard^] directly from the SuiteCRM interface
 . From the command line (so-called _silent upgrade_)

=== Update from command line

{{% notice info %}}
Command line update is only available in version 7.11.3 and newer
{{% /notice %}}

 . Download the required link:https://suitecrm.com/upgrade-suitecrm[upgrade pack^] and 
place it in the folder with the installed system
 . From the folder with the installed system, run the command
 `./vendor/bin/robo upgrade:suite [upgradeZipFile] [logFile] [pathToSuiteCRMInstance] [adminUser]`, where

 * *upgradeZipFile* - downloaded upgrade package
 * *logFile* - log file name
 * *pathToSuiteCRMInstance* - the path to the installed SuiteCRM instance
 * *adminUser* - name of user with administrative rights

Example:

[source, shell]
 ./vendor/bin/robo upgrade:suite SuiteCRM-Upgrade-7.11.x-to-7.11.4.zip upgradeLog.log . admin
