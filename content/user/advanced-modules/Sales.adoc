= Advanced Open Sales

The first 'Suite' of advanced modules is AOS(Advanced Open Sales). The
various modules that are part of the AOS suite of modules allow you to
manage the Post-Opportunity Sales processes such as Quoting, Invoicing
and recurring Contracting. This functionality is made available to you
through the following modules:

* *Product Categories*
* *Products*
* *PDF Templates*
* *Quotations*
* *Invoices*
* *Contracts*

== AOS Settings

System Administrator users can alter the settings for AOS using the AOS
Settings page under the Advanced OpenSales panel within the Admin Panel.

You can customise the following settings within the AOS Settings:

* *Renewal Reminder Period* – This defines how many days before the
Contract End Date that a reminder call should be created.
* *Initial Invoice Number* – Allows users to set the initial invoice
number. For example 20001.
* *Initial Quote Number* – Allows users to set the initial quote number.
For example 456.
* *Enable Line Items Groups* – If selected then users will be able to
bundle line items into groups. If this is not selected then you will not
be able to use the AOS Group functionality. 
{{% notice note %}}
This setting should
be selected before using AOS – It is difficult to migrate from/to groups
once Quotes/Invoices have been created.
{{% /notice %}}

The module also allows users to define a Cost and Price for the product.
Price is the selling price which will be used in the quoting process. A
related Contact can be associated to the product. This is the point of

of the product then this can be uploaded within the products record. A
URL to the products page on your website can also be specified.

The Product Categories module allows Users to structure Products into a
hierarchical category structure. To create a Product Category record,

Categories' button in the action bar.

The Parent Category field is a relationship field to another Product
Categories record. If you check the *'Is Parent Category'* field then this
signifies that the category is the highest level. Once selected you will
not be able to select a Parent Category using the relate field.

== PDF Templates


=== Creating Templates

AOS allows users to generate PDF documents and merge data from SuiteCRM
modules. You must however create a PDF template first.

templates. You must select a Type. This is the module you are building
the PDF Template for. By default the modules you can select are: Quotes

note that the drop down 'Item Name' must be the name of the module
directory.

module. This will be the either the same module as the Type or a related
module to the Type module. This is selected using the first drop down on
the Insert Fields row.

section as a table.
