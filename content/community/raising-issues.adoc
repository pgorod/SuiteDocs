== Raising Issues

An issue is an area where you can feel the project could be improved,
for example, you could report a problem or bug you've encountered while
using the software, a feature you feel is missing, or a gap in the
project's documentation.

When raising issues via our GitHub repository ensure you state the issue
clearly with a full description of steps to reproduce, what version(s)
of SuiteCRM the issue was found in and; if relevant what platform it is
running on and a screenshot of the issue. This will allow any
contributor to easily identify and potentially address the issue. Here
is the GitHub guide to all things issues.

Here is a https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues/8535[good example of a raised issue^].

== Security

We take Security seriously here at SuiteCRM so if you have discovered a
security risk report it by emailing security@suitecrm.com. This will be
delivered to the product team who handle security issues. *Please don't
disclose security bugs publicly* until they have been handled by the
security team.

Your email will be acknowledged within 24 hours during the business week
(Mon - Fri), and youâ€™ll receive a more detailed response to your email
within 72 hours during the business week (Mon - Fri) indicating the next
steps in handling your report.
