== Target Lists

The Target Lists module in SuiteCRM is used to separate Targets into
groups, these can be groups of individuals that should be excluded from
a particular Campaign, test groups or a list of Targets grouped by
certain criteria, for example area or market an organisation works in.

=== Target Lists Actions

You can access the Target Lists actions from the Target Lists module
menu drop down or via the Sidebar. The Target Lists actions are as
follows:

* *Create Target List* – A new form is opened in Edit View to allow you to
create a new Target List record.
* *View Target Lists* – Redirects you to the List View for the Target
Lists module. This allows you to search and list Target List records.

To view the full list of fields available when creating a Target List,
See link:./../../appendix-a/#_targets_field_list[Target Lists Field List].

=== Managing Target Lists

which is sortable. This will sort the column either ascending or
descending.

=== Target List Types
A target list can specify individuals or organization who need to be included in a campaign or excluded 
from a campaign. This can be controlled using the following target list types:

[cols="30h,70", options="header"]
|=======
|Target List Type |Description
|Default |The normal list of targets you intend to send your campaign to.
|Seed |These targets will receive the campaign, but they won't be recorded in the statistics 
for the campaign on the *View Status* page. You can use this list for people who preview and approve your 
campaign email before it is actually sent to everybody else, or any other use where tracking is not desired.
|Suppression List - By Domain |Targets with email domain names on this list will be suppressed, so the campaign 
email will not be sent to them. So, if you need to keep all emails belonging to "somesite.com" from going out, 
you add that domain to this list.
|Suppression List - By Email Address |Targets with individual email addresses on this list will be suppressed, 
so the campaign email will not be sent to them. A typical use of this list is for people who have opted-out 
of from receiving emails from your company, or from a specific campaign.
|Suppression List - By Id |Here the suppression is made by linking SuiteCRM records (Contacts, Leads, Targets, 
Accounts, Users) to the target list. This is different from the previous option because a single record may have 
several emails which will all be excluded. When you're setting up a Newsletter Campaign, in order to have an 
operational opt-out link in the emails, a suppression list of this kind is required to be linked to the Campaign.
|Test |The list of those you want to receive the test emails from the Campaign, while you're still working on 
the form and content of your message. You can send your Campaign to the test list multiple times by using 
the btn:[Delete Test Entries] button on the *View Status* page between re-sends.
