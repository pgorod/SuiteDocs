= Workflows

*Workflows* is a module for SuiteCRM allowing users to
create custom workflow processes. Historically this module was called *Advanced Open Workflow (AOW)*. 
It allows users to trigger various system actions based on conditions from any SuiteCRM module.

== Creating a Workflow Process

You can create workflow processes by navigating to the 'Workflow' module
within SuiteCRM. Click the *'Create Workflow'* button within the action
bar to start creating the process. The first panel allows users to set
up the workflow process.

image:106Creating_a_workflow.png[title="Creating a Workflow"]

This allows you to specify the following:

* *Name* – Any name you want to give to the Workflow.
* *Assigned To* - The assigned user of the Workflow process.
* *Workflow Module* – A drop down list of all the modules found within the
SuiteCRM instance. This is the module the Workflow is run against. For
example, when an Account is created/edited.
* *Status* – Active or Inactive. Only active processes will run, so you can use this field 
to deactivate a Workflow without having to delete it.
* *Run* – This controls the way the Workflow is triggered.
+
[cols="20,80"]
|================================================================
|*On Save* | The Workflow will run immediately for a given record when a save action occurs in the module specified.
|*On Scheduler* | The Workflow will be started from the Scheduler Job *Process Workflow Tasks*, 
the next time the job runs, and will apply to every record in the module, 
restricted by the *Run on* property and by the Workflow's conditions.
|*Always* | The Workflow will run on both the situations described above.
|================================================================
+
* *Run On* – This specifies the selection of records for which the Workflow will be executed.
+
[cols="20,80"]
|================================================================
|*New Records* | The Workflow will run only for new records being created.
|*Modified Records* | The Workflow will run only for records that were already created and are being changed.
|*All Records* | 
- For *On Save* workflows, this means the Workflow will run for both new and modified records. +
- For *On Scheduler* Workflows, this means the Workflow will go through every record in the module, 
even old ones that weren't changed.
{{% notice tip %}}
When setting *On Scheduler*, *All Records* Workflows, consider that they might cause very long operations 
if your module has many records. These operations will run in the background, but will still consume server resources, so it's a good idea to run them after work hours.
{{% /notice %}}
|================================================================
+
* *Repeated Runs* – Workflows keep track of each individual record that they have been applied to in the past. 
This allows you to control whether you want the Workflow actions to run only once for each record, 
or repeatedly, as the Worfklow is triggered again. +
+
[cols="20,80"]
|================================================================
|*Unchecked* | The Workflow will be blocked from running against any record that has already 
been handled by the current Workflow in the past.
|*Checked* | The Workflow will run against every record, regardless of whether that record has already
been handled by the current Workflow in the past.
{{% notice tip %}}
It is wise to consider whether there are enough restrictions in place so that this 
will not create excessive runs. +
For example, if one of the specified Actions negates (or will lead to the negation) of one of the specified Conditions; 
or if the Workflow is set to target individual records (*On Save*, *New Records*, *Modified Records*).
{{% /notice %}}
|================================================================
+
* *Description* – useful to include a description of the process, its intended goals, 
and other notes to clarify what the current Workflow is all about.

== Conditions

=== Adding Conditions

Once set up, you can add conditions to a workflow process using the
conditions panel. This allows you to specify restrictive criteria so that only the records matching 
all these conditions will be affected by the Worklow's Acions.

image:107Adding_conditions.png[title="Add Condition"]

To add a Condition Line you must click btn:[Add Condition]

{{% notice note %}}
You must select your Workflow Module on the first panel before
adding a Condition Line.
{{% /notice %}}

image:206Add_condition.png[title="Add Condition"]

You can have an unlimited amount of Condition Lines. To add another line
click btn:[Add Condition] again and it will appear. On the line
you will have four fields; Field, Operator, Type and Value.

=== Field and Operator

Field is a drop down which automatically populates with all the fields
found in the Workflow Module.

image:109Field_box.png[title="Field Box"]

The Field selected will determine the options available for Operator and
Type. If the field type is not a number or date then the operators
available will be 'Equal To' or 'Not Equal To'. For number and date
fields you can also choose from additional logical operators; 'Less
Than', 'Greater Than', 'Less Than or Equal To' or 'Greater Than or Equal
To'.

image:110Operator_box.png[title="Operator Box"]

=== Condition Types

You can specify workflow processes to trigger on different condition
types. These are as follows:

* *Value* – This is used to directly compare the Field to a value. The value
type offered is dynamic to the field type of the Field selected. For
example, if the field type is a drop down then the value field type will
be the same drop down list.

image:111Value_condition.png[title="Value"]

* *Field* – This is used to action a workflow process when one field is
compared to another field in the record.

image:112Field_condition.png[title="Field"]

* *Multiple* – This can be selected if the Field is a drop down/multiselect.
This allows users to specify multiple values to action the workflow
from.

image:113Multiple_condition.png[title="Multiple"]

* *Date* – This allows you to specify the record to be selected for the Workflow 
after/before an amount of time from either another date field or 'Now'. For example,
when the start date of a call is 'Now + 10 minutes'. This can only be
used when the Field is a date field. The amount of time before or after
the date can be specified in Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks or Months.

image:114Date_condition.png[title="Date"]

=== Removing Conditions

You can remove Condition Lines by clicking btn:[-] on the left-hand side of the condition.

image:115Removing_conditions.png[title="Removing Conditions"]

== Actions

=== Adding Actions

Actions are defined in the third panel. These specify what events should
occur when the conditions have been met. You can add an Action by
clicking the btn:[Add Action] button.

image:116Adding_actions.png[title="Add Action"]

This will cause the Action Line to appear.

image:207Action_line.png[title="Action Line"]

From the Action Line you can Select Action and give it a Name. The
actions available are; 'Create Record', 'Modify Record' and 'Send
Email'. You can specify an unlimited amount of actions for each workflow
process.

==== Create Record

If you select *'Create Record'* you will be prompted to select a Record
Type. This is the module type of the record you are looking to create.

image:208Create_record.png[title="Create Record"]

Once selected you can add fields or relationships to this record using
the btn:[Add Field] and btn:[Add Relationship] buttons.

image:209Add_field-relationship1.png[title="Add Field/Relationship"]

When Adding fields the first drop down in the line will populate with
all the fields from that module. The second drop down allows you to
specify how the value for that field is going to be derived. For most
cases the options are as follows:

* *Value* – This will allow you to input the value directly using the same
field type as the field selected.
* *Field* – This will make the field the same value as a field found in
the Workflow Module.
* *Date* – Only selectable if the field is a date field. This will allow
you to specify the value as an amount of time after/before another date
field or 'Now'.

image:210Adding_fields.png[title="Adding Fields"]

Selecting the 'Assigned-To' field also gives you more options. As well
as by value and field you can assign a user by:

* *Round Robin* – This will select each user in turn.
* *Least Busy* – This will select you with the least amount of records
assigned to you for that module.
* *Random* – This will select a random user.

For each of the above options you can choose if you want you to be
selected from all users or users from a specific role. If you have the
SecuritySuite module installed you can additionally choose if you want
you to be selected from all users from a particular Security Group or
all users from a particular security group with a particular role.

image:121Assigned_field.png[title="Assigned Field"]

When adding relationships you must select the related module from the
drop down list then select the record that the new record should be
related to.

image:212Add_relationship.png[title="Add Relationship"]

{{% notice note %}}
You must selected the related module using the arrow button – The
auto completion on the text field is not currently developed.
{{% /notice %}}

==== Modify Record

This provides the same functionality as 'Create Record' but instead of
creating a new record you are modifying the record which met the
conditions of the workflow process. With this action you can modify any
field found within the record or you can add a relationship to another
record. This is completed in the same way as 'Create Record' except you
are not required to specify the Record Type.

==== Send Email

The *'Send Email'* action allows users to create workflow processes which
will send an email based on an template to individuals. 

{{% notice note %}}
The Email will be sent from the System Email Account. It is not possible to send from Emails 
specified in the User Profile, because Workflows sometimes run from a Scheduler job, 
without any user being logged on.
{{% /notice %}}

Using this action there are four different types of recipient.

* *Email* – This will send an email to a specific email address. You must
specify the email address and the email template.

image:213Send_email_to.png[title="Send Email"]

* *Record Email* – This will send an email to the primary email address
specified on the record which actioned the workflow process. This can
only be used if the record has an email field such as Accounts and
Contacts. For this option you only need to specify the template.

image:image127.png[title="Record Email"]

* *User* – This will send the email to a specified Users email address. You
must specify the recipient user and the template of the email.

image:214Send_email_to_user.png[title="User"]

* *Related Field* – This will send an email to the primary email address
specified on a related modules record. In this case you must specify the
related module (From a drop down list) and the email template.

image:215Email_related_field.png[title="Related Field"]

=== Calculated Fields

If you select *'Calculate Fields'* from the Action dropdown the Calculate
Fields user interface will be loaded after a second and looks like the
picture below.

image:216Calculate_fields.png[title="Calculate Fields"]

There is a separate page with detailed documentation of the many possibilities of 
link:../workflow-calculated-fields/[Calculated Fields] in Workflows.

== Process Audit

Advanced OpenWorkflow allows users to audit your processes. In the
Detail View of each Workflow record there is a sub-panel called
*'Processed Flows'*.

image:image132.png[title="Process Audit"]

This lists all the workflow processes which have been actioned including
details on the record which actioned the flow, its status and the date
it was created.

image:image133.png[title="Process Audit"]

You can view this information at a higher level by clicking the *'View
Process Audit'* button within the module action bar. This will show all
the processes that have run for all the Workflow records.
