= In-line Editing

In-line editing gives you the ability to change values “on the fly”.
In-line editing has been implemented on both List View and Detail View,
providing an advantage to users wishing to change field values quickly,
reducing the number of clicks/processes that would normally be taken to
edit the full record.

{{% notice note %}}
In-line editing can be enabled/disabled for both List View and
Detail View. This can be done in the main System Settings for the CRM,
by the System Administrator.
{{% /notice %}}

Once you have made the required change to the field value, you can

If you navigate away without saving any changes, you will see a prompt
warning you that you have made unsaved changes to the field being
edited.
