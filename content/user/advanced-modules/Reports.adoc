== Reports

Advanced Open Reports (AOR) is the reporting module within SuiteCRM. AOR
can be accessed by clicking the *'Reports'* link within the navigation
menu. The reporting module allows users to report on CRM data from any
module and has many features to display key information quickly.

=== Creating Reports

To create a report, hover over the Reports module on the navigation bar
and select *'Create Report'*.

Module drop down.

===== Adding Fields

Once you have selected a Report Module, the list of fields available
will display on the left panel. You can add fields to the 'Fields'
section of the report by expanding the module you wish to select fields
from and then drag and drop those fields into the field section.

image:233Report_fields.png[title="Adding Fields"]

Once you have added fields to a Report, there are multiple options to
configure for those fields:

* *Display* – True or false option. Allows you to specify whether this
field should be displayed on the report, or hidden. Users may wish to
add fields to perform a function/sort/group/total but may not wish to
show this on the Report.<br/>

* *Link* – True or false option. Allows you to make the field a link.
Setting this option to true will hyperlink the field on the Detail View
of the report, allowing you to click on the record. This will navigate
you to the appropriate record. For example, linking the Opportunity Name
will take you to the Detail View of that Opportunity.<br/>

* *Label* – This is the label that will be displayed for the Column/Field
on the Report. You can change the label from the default to any
alphanumerical value.<br/>

* *Function* - Provides five options: Count, Minimum, Maximum, Sum and
Average. Allows you to perform functions on alphanumerical fields. Users
may wish to calculate the average Opportunity Amount, or Count total
Opportunities at a given Sales Stage.<br/>

* *Sort* – Ascending or Descending. Allows you to select whether to sort
the field/column descending or ascending. This can be done for all
fields.<br/>

* *Group* – True or false option. Allows you to group by this field. For
example, you may wish to group by Sales Stage when reporting on an
Opportunity.<br/>

* *Total* – Provides three options: Count, Sum and Average. This allows
users to perform total calculations on numerical fields. This is useful
for financial reporting such as the total value of all Opportunities at
a given Sales Stage.<br/>

===== Adding Conditions

Once you have added the fields to your Report, you can add condition
lines to the Report. You can add conditions with the same procedure as
adding fields. Using the drag and drop functionality, you can drag
fields into the 'Conditions' area which will add the field and allow you
to specify the condition for that field.

=== Charts

You can add charts to Reports. Charts provide a visual representation of
the Report data to you. In some scenarios, or for particular users,
visual aids such as charts can assist quicker analysis and better
understanding.

data. These are:
