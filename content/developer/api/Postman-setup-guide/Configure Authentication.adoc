== Configure Authentication: Obtaining A Session

The SuiteCRM API requires that a client has an active session to consume
the API. Sessions are acquired by authenticating with the
http://oauth2.thephpleague.com/[OAuth 2 Server], using one of the
available grant types.

== Configure Grant Types
Before you can consume the API, you must first configure SuiteCRM to
grant access to a client. SuiteCRM 7.10 provides an administrative
panel, through which you can add clients and revoke tokens. To configure the grant types, select the admin panel, and then select OAuth2 Clients and Tokens:
